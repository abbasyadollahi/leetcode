"""
You and I are working together to build the part of our team's application that will let users query about properties of series.

Users will be able to make requests like:
 - What is the Nth element of the series?
 - Is N a member of the series?
 - What is the smallest member of the series greater than N?

Examples of series:
 - Fibonacci numbers
 - prime numbers
 - nÂ² - 2n

I will be working on the user interface, and you will be building the back-end library that my piece will call.
For the first release we only have to implement the "Is N a member of...?" question for the Fibonacci and prime number series,
although we will have to support both more queries and more series later, so the service needs to be extensible.
